                    Commerce Technologies has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 
                    The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all its websites.<br /><br />

                    Our sites' registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). 
                    We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and 
                    promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor 
                    when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br /><br />

                    Our sites use an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact 
                    information (like their email address, phone number and mailing address). Contact information from the order form is used 
                    to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The 
                    customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving 
                    future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br /><br />
                    Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to 
                    send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact 
                    information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the

                    We run contests on our sites in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact 
                    data from our contests to send users information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. 
                    The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future 
                    mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br /><br />
