                <span class="LabelsBody">Studies show online shoppers' overwhelming concern with security and the value that trust marks hold in their minds. 
                The following statistics are from an April 2005 study conducted by TNS, an independent research firm:</span><br />
                <span class="LabelsBody"><img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                Consumers are very aware of trust marks and understand what they represent.<br /> 
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                78 percent of online shoppers say that a seal indicates that their information is secure.<br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                Only one in five shoppers did not know what purpose trust marks served. <br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                The overwhelming majority of consumers feel it is important for sites to include a trust mark.<br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                88 percent of U.S. online shoppers say it is important for an e-commerce site to include a trustmark of some kind on its site. <br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                79 percent of online shoppers expect to see a trust mark displayed on a Web site's home page. The majority of shoppers also expect to see 
                trust marks displayed on the page where personal information is entered and where the final transaction is completed. <br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                71 percent of online consumers shop only at sites they know and trust, while 38 percent of online shoppers will only make purchases through 
                sites that include a trust mark. <br />
                <img src="images/obullet.gif" height="8" width="8" border="0">
                Shoppers not only recognize and value third-party trust marks, but the presence of a trust mark can also persuade them to complete the purchase.<br />

                Nearly 70 percent of online shoppers have terminated an online order because they did not "trust" the transaction. In those cases, 53 percent indicated 
                that the presence of a seal would have likely prevented the termination. <br />
