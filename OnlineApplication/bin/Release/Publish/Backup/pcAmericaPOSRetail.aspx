                    <li class="LabelsBody">Track Inventory and Reduce Theft in your Retail Store: Accurate and robust inventory control is a key component of your retail store’s profit margins and overall success. The inventory tracking capabilities within Cash Register express detail which products are selling, what needs to be reordered and identifies items that have been stolen or are otherwise missing.  </li>
                    <li class="LabelsBody">Track your Purchases: The integrated purchasing functionality is used to track vendor lists, manage item costs and generate and receive purchase orders.

System functions such as discounts, no-sales, voids, and price changes can be accessed or restricted based on an employee’s unique login ID or job code. Various reports can be generated on this activity to identify potential theft or wrongdoing. Strict cash control features can be used to identify cash discrepancies down to the shift or the cashier. A security camera system can be connected to your retail point of sale system to further enhance the accountability of your employees and security of your store.</li>
                    <li class="LabelsBody">Reduce Labor Cost: Labor is typically your largest expense outside the cost of the products being sold like any other retail business.
