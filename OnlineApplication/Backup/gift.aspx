                The winners are those who establish and maintain one or more competitive advantages in the minds of their customers. 
                <strong> Gift and/or Loyalty Card program by </strong> creates a compelling reason for consumers to prefer one business over another. 
                With a <strong>Gift and /or Loyalty Card</strong> in his or her wallet, a customer is much more likely to choose that merchant for future purchases.<br/><br/></span></td>

                <span class="LabelsBody"><strong>Gift Cards</strong> are sold to customers for their own use or can be gifted to family or friends. 
                Cards can be redeemed at store locations just like a credit card and balances can be debited from the card upon purchase. 
                Cards are swiped through traditional credit card terminals, POS systems, Virtual Terminal or website and payments are collected by the merchant at the time of sale. <br/><br/>
                
                <strong>Loyalty cards</strong> are typically issued or given to the customer at the business location. 
                The card is then presented each time the customer visits and points, dollars or % amounts are added to the card based on predetermined reward program that the merchant sets. 
                One of the most important advantages of having a Loyalty solution is that merchants have the ability to collect important cardholder demographic information like: name, address, email, birthday etc. 
                Customers spending patterns can be tracked and special targeted offers can be sent directly from the merchant. <br/><br/>
                
                <strong>Shop Local Program</strong> The Shop Local Card is a gift card that can be used universally between multiple merchant types participating in a Shop Local Program. 
                Even better—each participating merchant can have a Loyalty/Rewards program that is specifically designed to help increase foot traffic and sales for their business. 
                Shop Local merchants benefit from the combined marketing power of multiple businesses cross promoting each other. 
                Shopping local is an excellent means of promoting businesses in the community and developing loyal customers through a network of participating merchants.
