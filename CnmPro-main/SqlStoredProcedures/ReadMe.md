# SQL Procs

You can add in the procs you want reviewed.

The file names should have the same name as the proc.

If you have many procs to export you can do so 1 at a time by simply saving the proc script or use the section titled "Generating SQL Scripts - Exporting Schema/Objects and Data via Scripting" within your SQL Reference Task.
