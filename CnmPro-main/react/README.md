# _Sabio_ Customizations

> Be sure you read this file in its entirety before you think about coding. Much of this should be review, but some of it may not be so be sure you take the time to educate yourself on these important points. 

## Logging in React 
>  No more console.log statements

Look at how the `debug` module (aka logger) is implemented by viewing the console. The SabioInit component will help you set up your env/localStorage so that you can see the debug package in action.

The logger will allow you to turn on and off specific logger instances. You do this by specifying what namespaces you want to see. Different namespaces comma separated and can end in wildcards (aka \* )

Any namespace starting with &quot;sabio:Wild\*&quot; such as &quot;sabio:Wildcard&quot; or &quot;sabio:WildBill&quot; or just &quot;sabio:Wild&quot; will be shown.

Follow the instructions provide in the there with the help of the links below to further customize.

Change what is actually seen by changing the localStore key of "debug" to "sabio:\*" (do not use the quotes)

### Blackboxing the logger scripts

You will need to blackbox a couple of scripts so that the console.log lines show up correctly.
When you have the logs from the debug/logging tool showing, click on the line that shows up to the right side of the console.

Once you open up that code file you will need to black box that file.
You will have to reload and the page and repeat the process for at least 2 times until the line numbers that up on the far right are the line numbers that you are expecting

## Compile Errors

This application is much more strict about the development practices you follow. The errors you will encounter will easily be explained with a quick google search.

> :warning: Do not disable these feature locally as the remote server will pick up many of the errors when you commit code.

### Prop-types

Prop types will be enforced. You can read more about them [on github](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)

## The .env.development file

The start up scripts should have created a copy for you to modify and customize with your own user settings.

This file is not going to be pushed to the git server so you can edit freely without affecting other developers.

````
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# These settings are intended to be changed by each developer to customize the
# credentials their logged in user have while they interact with the application
# ------------------------------------------------------------
REACT_APP_TEMP_USER_ID="198"
REACT_APP_TEMP_USER_NAME="SabioFellow"
REACT_APP_TEMP_USER_ROLE="Developer"

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# These settings will probably not need to be managed by each developer differently.

# Api Endpoints
#

# These api endpoints will leverage cross site calls and will only work if CORS is set up correctly
# These are the default setting used by the application.
REACT_APP_API_HOST_PREFIX="https://localhost:50001"
REACT_APP_API_NODE_HOST_PREFIX="http://localhost:8080/node-api"
# To go through proxy put these swap out the last two api vars for these
# REACT_APP_API_HOST_PREFIX=""
# REACT_APP_API_NODE_HOST_PREFIX=""

# Enable for verbose logging from the sabio logging namespacing
REACT_APP_VERBOSE=true

# Enable Api Endpoints tests at startup. The api's are enabled regardless of these flags

## Code Splitting

We will be lazy loading many modules in the application. You should read about "code splitting" here:

- https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting
- https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html



## Path Alias

Within the application you have a set of "path aliases" set up to make referencing code files in commonly used folder more conveniently.

For example, instead of importing  `userService.js` like so 

```js
import * as service from "./../../../services/userService" 
```

you can simply write


```js
import * as service from "@services/userService" 
```

These are the following alias in this application:

- **@services** maps to "./src/services",
- **@components** maps to "./src/components"



# State Management

The application you are diving into may be using other state management tools and libraries that we have not explored. Here are some simple guidelines to help you work with these.

### Redux

Redux is a global state management library. It allows you to manage state globally so that you do not have to worry about passing state into child components or passing data back up to parents. 

The application you jump into may be using redux to manage theme level settings. You should not have to worry about those settings at all.

Learning Redux is a large task. With the wider adoption of React Context and lesser so, other state management libraries we have determined is not  the best use of your time while you training with us.

**In short, do not spend any time trying to learn this while you with us. Please ask an instructor if you feel like you need to engage with Redux.**

### Hooks

Hooks is something you should learn. The Lifecyle and principles about state management in React manifest themselves with hooks, although you have to learn how to manage the Lifecyle slightly differently.

The hooks you should first focus on are the following:

- useState
- useEffect
- useMemo

Read about those here:

- https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
- https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html



## Messages to user

### toastr

Working Example in *SabioInit* Component

We will be using this package to give the user messages or feedback.
