                The following are examples of how we have tried to make a difference. Our offices are painted with non-VOC paint 
                (Volatile organic compounds). We use automatic light switches that turn off as soon as the employees leave their 
                offices. We have instituted paper minimization practices such as rarely using post-it notes, printing only when 
                it is absolutely necessary and using both sides of each sheet of paper. Additionally, we have paperless practices 
                such as sending and receiving faxes electronically and the storage of all customer files electronically on our 
                secure servers. We recycle paper, plastic and other recyclable materials. We do not use disposable utensils, 
                plates, glasses, etc. and when possible, purchase these products in recyclable form.

                <span class="LabelsBody">Most of our equipment is shipped with a manufacturer’s warranty. Most new equipment comes with a 1 year 
                manufacturer’s warranty, refurbished equipment comes with a 3 month manufacturer’s warranty and used equipment has no warranty. 
                However, we will repair or replace any defective product within 30 days of the sale. Most warrantees are handled DIRECTLY through the manufacturer(s) after the return period. For any equipment purchases that include 
                a merchant account or other services we established for the customer, we program and test the equipment on-site to ensure that 
                upon receiving, it is functional and ready for use "out of the box."
