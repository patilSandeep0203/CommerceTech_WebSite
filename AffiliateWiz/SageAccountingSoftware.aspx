                <b>Ten ways Sage 50 beats the competition</b><br/><br/>
                
                Every small business has unique goals and faces unique challenges. That’s why whether you are starting a new business in your basement or have multiple locations and dozens of employees, Sage 50 offers a range of solutions. Even better, Sage 50 includes features and benefits you won’t find with other options. We beat the competition by providing advice that adapts to your needs, tools to simplify your business life, and exactly what you need to help you meet your goals and run your business with confidence. 
Here’s how we do it:<br/><br/>

                <b>1. Sage 50 supports you like no one else </b><br/>
                Your Sage 50 purchase comes fully supported and includes valuable tools and services that help you save time and money.1 With Sage 50, you get access to our North American-based customer support, product updates, and more! You’ll feel secure knowing that assistance is close at hand when you need it. These benefits are part of your auto renewing Sage Business Care plan1 and are included as part of your product purchase!<br/><br/>
                <b>2. Advice that adapts to your needs </b><br/>
               You need advice, guidance, and answers. Sage Advisor provides them—24/7, on-screen, online, where and when you need them. Sage Advisor is your personal coach, answering questions you might not even think to ask. <br/><br/>
                <b>3. Insights that help you make better decisions</b><br/>
              Find the insights buried in your data, like which customers to target or where your best opportunities are for profitability. Sage 50 Intelligence Reporting helps uncover them by providing custom reporting and analysis integrated with Sage 50 using the familiar interface of Microsoft® Excel® and your real-time Sage 50 data. Intelligence Reporting is a dramatically better way to search for insights, ideas, and innovation in your business. <br/><br/>
                <b>4. Accounting principles that give you the most accurate financials</b><br/>
               You’re not a CPA, but that does not mean you should keep your business books using the same method as your personal accounts. Sage 50 uses double-entry accounting, which is more accurate than other methods and is an industry best practice. <br/><br/>
                <b>5. In-depth audit and security functions to protect your data (and your money)</b><br/>
                Your small business cannot afford to lose money because of accounting errors or fraud. The Sage 50 Internal Accounting Review2 can help find potential accounting errors with up to 15 different checks of data. It looks for common mistakes as well as suspicious transactions. Plus, with module- or screen-level security and audit trails, you can track who is entering data, editing existing entries, or accessing particular functions. <br/><br/>
                

                <b>6. Customized dashboards and management centers so you stay in the know</b><br/>
                With easy access to information, you can improve customer service, take action quickly, and better plan purchases and spending. That’s the power of the Sage 50 dashboards and management centers. Get high-level views of key business metrics and quickly drill down to the details. Plus, each center is customizable, so you can view the most important information for your business. </b><br/>
