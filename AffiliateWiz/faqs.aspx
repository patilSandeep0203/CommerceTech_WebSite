                <br />
               The Tier Pricing is the most popular pricing method and the simplest system for most merchants to understand. In 3-Tier Pricing, the merchant account provider groups the transactions into 3 groups (tiers) and assigns a rate to each tier based on a criterion established for each tier. There are a lot of different factors that can influence the rate you are given by your merchant account provider:
Type of card being used (a no-frills Visa card versus a Visa Rewards Card will process at different rate "tiers;" the interchange on a rewards card will be higher)
The way a transaction is processed (swipe in-person, over-the-phone orders, keying in card number in-person, accepting payments online)
The type of business accepting the card (are you selling high-risk, high ticket items? Is your business type historically prone to troublesome chargebacks?)
<br/> Typically there are 4 tiers that are set depending on the type of business as follows:<br/>
Debit: Debit cards where the PIN is entered by the customer at check out<br/>
Qualified: Check cards that are swiped through the terminal.<br/>
Mid-Qualified: Check cards that are keyed in to the terminal, Rewards cards that are swiped or keyed into the terminal<br/>
Non-Qualified: Corporate or international cards swiped or keyed

                <br />
               The qualified rate is charged for a normal payment made on a standard credit card. These transactions are the least expensive for merchants because they carry the smallest risk of fraud or human error. Non reward credit cards fall into the qualified rate category unless they are manually keyed into the terminal.

                <br />
               The mid-qualified rate is charged for transactions that do not fit the criteria for the qualified rate. For example, the mid-qualified rate is charged if a sales clerk manually keys in credit card information instead of swiping the customer’s card (the clerk must perform address verification; otherwise the merchant will pay the non-qualified rate). Rewards cards and some business cards fall into the mid-qualified category.

                <br />
               The non-qualified rate is the highest rate a merchant can be charged for a credit card transaction. This rate is charged when a sales clerk manually enters a card and does not perform address verification or when other necessary information is absent at the time of the transaction. Most corporate and promotional cards fall into the non-qualified category.

                The interchange fee that is supposed to cover the risk of fraud, transactional costs, and other overhead had become 
                a big expense for the small retailers unlike the big merchants who had the power to negotiate. The Durbin Amendment 
                was therefore passed as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation in 2010 to require the Federal Reserve to 
                limit fees charged to retailers for debit card processing. The rule also allowed non-exempt card issuers to charge a 
                one-cent fraud prevention fee to merchants in addition to another 0.7 percent for fraud prevention already included 
                in the interchange fee.</span>

                <br />
                AVS is a service that is built into the authorization process to
                    help prevent fraudulent transactions. The numerical portion of a consumer's address
                    is sent along with the transaction data and is matched against the address that
                    is registered with the consumer's credit card from their issuer's bank. A response
                    code is sent back with the approval (or decline) message that indicates a match
                    or not. Currently, a match or mismatch is simply reported back to the merchant and
                    may or may not result in a transaction decline depending on the POS settings. The
                    merchant then has the option to contact their customer to confirm the correct address
                    before they ship any goods.</span>

                In the event that a merchant does not have a matching company name and TIN within the IRS database

                all deposits for such non-compliant merchants and remitting such withholding amounts directly 
                to the IRS. The process of repocessing these funds will be between the merchant and IRS.   
                Furthermore, there are also several state governments that will implement similar rules and 
                therefore will require withholding of an additional percentage of a merchant's 
                funds (as determined on a state by state basis). </span>

                <br />
               EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, Visa—the three companies that created a global standard for credit and debit card acceptance. This standard is now adopted by all major brands including American Express, and Discover/Diners Club. EMV credit and debit cards have a secure microchip on the front of the card. The microchip adds a new level of security, protecting sensitive cardholder information. During a payment transaction the embedded microchip works in concert with an EMV-enabled terminal to complete the transaction.

                <br />
              EMV is designed to reduce credit card fraud resulting from lost, stolen or counterfeit cards used in a card present (CP) transaction. EMV is widely deployed in Europe, Canada, and parts of Asia and will become common throughout the U.S. over the next several years.

                <br />
              During a payment transaction the secure microchip generates a unique, one-time dynamic code that is used by the card issuer to verify a card is valid. Using a dynamic code during each transaction combats card cloning and skimming since the code can’t be reused to create another transaction. EMV cards can also be used to make contactless transactions while retaining the same level of security.

                <br />
              Instead of swiping a card, customers will “dip” their EMV card into an EMV terminal. The card will remain in the terminal throughout the transaction. Customers may also be prompted to enter their PIN or provide a signature, just as they do today with traditional swipe cards. Many EMV terminals also support contactless payments giving customers the option to hold their card near the terminal to complete a transaction.

                <br />
              No. A chip card must be inserted into an enabled terminal that allows the chip to make contact with the reader to authorize and complete the transaction. On the other hand, contactless cards employ near-field communication (NFC), which transmits account information by waving or tapping the card in front of an enabled device.

              Chip & PIN and Chip & Signature are two types of chip cards in the market.  Chip & PIN requires a PIN to complete the transaction and any data stolen from the merchant is useless because the transaction data expires after it leaves the Chip & PIN reader.  Chip & Signature requires a customer signature to complete the transaction. In the U.S., most card companies are only offering Chip & Signature.
Chip cards also have the same magnetic stripes as non-chip cards and may be used in the traditional methods of swipe or key entry, but these transactions will not have the additional security protections provided through EMV card readers.

                <br />
             NFC is short for “Near Field Communications.” Essentially it allows customers to use their cell phone to make a payment simply by tapping it on an NFC-enabled payment terminal. The customer – using systems like Apple Pay, Android Pay or Softcard – no longer needs to find cash or their credit/debit card. They just tap their phone on the reader and the payment is processed.

                <br />
             NFC payment systems like Apple Pay begin with a microchip that’s built into the cell phone. The customer links the payment system on their phone to their bank account or credit card. When it comes time to make a purchase, customers tap or hold their NFC-enabled phone in close proximity to the NFC reader, which uses secure radio frequency technology to transfer transaction data.

                <br />
            NFC payments allow the customer to simply tap their NFC-enabled payment instrument (credit card, Smart phone, etc.) on your point-of-sale device, removing the need to swipe, insert or manually key. This saves time on both sides of the counter, alleviating lines that slow your business and frustrate your customers.

            NFC is not just another payment acceptance technology; it will provide a combined solution for integrating payment with non-payment applications, which could increase consumer traffic and sales. Emerging non-payment solutions such as digital couponing, loyalty programs and mobile wallets will help drive customers into stores. However, these consumers will expect merchants to integrate these new services with their payment in one transaction. Mobile wallets are available and in use today. Consumers can download these applications onto their mobile devices and store their payment credentials digitally. If they make a purchase at a POS that accepts NFC payments, they simply unlock their device and tap it to the terminal to initiate the payment. For added security, most mobile wallets and mobile devices now offer password protection and PIN entry to verify the cardholder’s identity and intent.</span>

            EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) is an electronic system in the US that allows the state governments to provide benefits to authorized recipients via a plastic debit card. Common benefits provided via EBT are typically sorted into two general categories, Food Stamps and Cash benefits. Through EBT, a recipient uses his/her EBT card to make purchases at participating retailers.
With our merchant account you can process transactions using EBT quickly and easily, so you can meet the needs of your customers.  <br />

            A payment card surcharge, also known as a checkout fee, is an additional fee that a merchant adds to a consumer's bill when he or she uses a card for payment. Merchants that elect to surcharge must provide advance written notice to Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and the merchant acquirer 30 days prior to surcharging. Merchants will be required to disclose their surcharge policy at the point of store entry and as well as at the point of sale prior to the purchase transaction being completed.

          Surcharging isn't allowed everywhere in the U.S. Currently, there are laws limiting surcharging in Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas. California's and New York's laws limiting surcharging have been enjoined from enforcement pursuant to court orders, but appeals are pending. An order upholding Florida's law limiting surcharging was reversed on appeal, but remains subject to further litigation. Consumers who are subjected to a surcharge in states where they may be prohibited from surcharging may want to report the retailer to their state attorney general's office.<br />

                <br />
      A cash discount occurs when a merchant decreases the price for cash purchases and offers merchants an alternative to credit card processing. Cash discount programs are not credit card surcharges because they do not levy a fee that is added to a credit card transaction. Both TSYS and First Data allow cash discounting. Merchants must clearly and conspicuously disclose the discount
to consumers.

                MAP (Merchant Acquiring Program) is our standard offering for all new merchants along with their Visa and MasterCard 
                accounts. With this program, merchants will process under the same discount rates for all card types except American 
                Express and receive one statement for all credit card types except American Express if they are not set up on 
                OptBlue. This program is offered only by our processors iPayment Inc., Innovative Merchant Solutions and Sage Payment 
                Solutions at this time. Optimal Payments merchants should have this option in the near future.

                <br />
                There are two types of debit card transactions: PIN-based (online) and signature-based (off-line). Debit cards that have a VISA or MasterCard 
                logo on them can be processed without entering a PIN code. These types of transactions are referred to as "off-line" debit transactions. In 
                this type of sale the merchant accepts a debit card the same way in which they would accept a normal credit card. The card is swiped through 
                the terminal and the consumer signs the receipt. As far as the merchant is concerned there is no difference in the way a credit card or an 
                off-line debit card is processed. Funds are transferred from the consumer's bank account just as in a PIN-based ("on-line") debit transaction. 
                However, the main disadvantage to the merchant is that the same discount fees charged to credit card transactions also apply to off-line debit 
                transactions, which may or may not increase the expense of processing based on your average ticket. </span>

                    directly to the card issuer, and the cardholders checking account is immediately debited for the transaction. Your customer receives a

                    account within 2 to 3 business days rather than immediately. With signature-based debit, youll pay a little more to process a transaction, 
                    eliminate the customer cash-back option and receive little protection against potential chargebacks.</span></li>

With each level of processing, there is a certain amount of data and requirements needed for verification and authorization. This data can range from very limited to very detailed, depending on the type of customers or clients your business serves. The more data fields required, the lower the processing rates.</span>

                The cardholder also has the option to not redeem an award and continue accumulating points in the program. Awards are given by the merchant according to merchants specific program rules. 
                For example, for every amount a customer spends, they receive a corresponding reward point. 
                A merchant may decide to reward 1 point for every dollar a customer spends on a purchase, and once the customer’s rewards points reach a specific level, the customer gets say $5 off next purchase, a free coffee mug, etc. 
                This in turn means repeat customer visits. </strong></span>

                <br />
                Gift Cards store available value and track purchases. Each time a gift card is used, the amount of value decreases based on the amount of purchase. 
                Loyalty cards store points and a reward is provided once a certain threshold is met. Rewards can be provided in dollar value or as a redeemable CLUB point. 
                Each time a loyalty card is used, points accumulate until the designated threshold is met. 
                Once the threshold is met, a reward point/value is generated back on the card to be used on the next visit. </span>

                    A Merchant Cash Advance, also known as Business Cash Advance, provides small 
                    to medium size business owners with access to the needed capital. The company providing the funds advances the cash by purchasing a pre-determined amount of the business sales volume sold through credit/debit card sales.

                The amount of receipts purchased is determined by the average credit card volume processed over a 180 day period. 
                Submission of any documentation (bank statements, sales tax receipts) that supports total sales volume is encouraged 
                in order to be approved for the highest amount possible. Approval for the largest amount possible will be based upon

                Yes, but this information won’t carry as much weight as it does in traditional financing scenarios. 
                With a Merchant Cash Advance, having a damaged personal credit history is not an automatic disqualifier. 
                Many businesses that have trouble with banks and other similar traditional financial institutions can qualify

                <br />
                Split funding is the normal cash advance payback structure where a small portion of your batch amount is transferred to the cash advance company directly from 
                the processor bank. This is only offered for merchants processing with those processors listed below. <br/><br/>
                
                Lockbox is offered by Rapid Advance and Business Financial Services for merchants that do not process with the below processors. With this program, 
                the entire batch amount is transferred to the lockbox and you receive your funds from the lockbox after the cash advance company gets their portion of the batch amount.<br/><br/>
                
                There is also ACH offered by all 3 funding providers where a fixed amount is withdrawn from your account everyday towards repayment of your cash advance regardless of the amount you processed. 
                This payback structure is usually used for Loan programs.

                The percentage is collected based solely on credit card sales. Usually if there are no credit card sales that month, no fees are collected. 
                In this case, the funding vendor will contact the merchant to check and see why credit card sales have been slow. 
                If business is consistently slow and merchant falls below a set threshold, the funding vendor will contact merchant and begin an investigation. </span>
